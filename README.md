# Fastify Server for Lazy Developers

This is a repo that contains the code of my articles and videos about how to build a [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/) server if you are a Node.js developer.

I will try to teach you how to build a Fastify server from scratch and we will cover REST and [GraphQL](https://mercurius.dev/#/) API.

I hope you will enjoy it!
